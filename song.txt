Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Day and night (what, what)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (what, what)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this (what, what)
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (what, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night(day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
